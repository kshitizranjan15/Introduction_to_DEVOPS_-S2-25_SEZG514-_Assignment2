| **Assignment**   | Assignment 1 — Implementing Automated CI/CD Pipelines for ACEest Fitness & Gym |

---

## Problem Statement

You have been appointed as a **Junior DevOps Engineer** for **ACEest Fitness & Gym**, a rapidly scaling startup. Your mission is to architect and implement a robust, automated deployment workflow that guarantees **code integrity**, **environmental consistency**, and **rapid delivery**.

The solution must transition the application through a rigorous lifecycle — from local development to an automated Jenkins BUILD environment.

---

## Objective

This assignment provides comprehensive, hands-on experience in modern DevOps methodologies. By executing this project, students attain professional proficiency in:

- **Version Control** — Git and GitHub
- **Containerization** — Docker
- **CI/CD Orchestration** — GitHub Actions and Jenkins

---

## Assignment Phases

### Phase 1 — Application Development & Modularization

Develop a foundational Flask web application tailored for fitness and gym management, built on baseline Python scripts that initialise core logic and service endpoints.

**Implemented endpoints:**

| Method | Endpoint    | Purpose                            | Status |
|--------|-------------|------------------------------------|--------|
| GET    | `/`         | Service sanity check / browser UI | 200    |
| GET    | `/health`   | Health check for monitoring        | 200    |
| GET    | `/workouts` | List all workouts                  | 200    |
| POST   | `/workouts` | Create a new workout               | 201    |
| GET    | `/members`  | List all members                   | 200    |
| POST   | `/members`  | Create a new member                | 201    |

**Design decisions:**
- **`create_app()` factory pattern** — the application can be instantiated cleanly in tests without global application state, making tests deterministic and independent.
- **In-memory stores** (`app.config["WORKOUTS"]`, `app.config["MEMBERS"]`) — keeps scope focused on DevOps concerns; easily replaceable with a persistent database in a later iteration.
- **Browser-aware root endpoint** — detects `Accept: text/html` to serve a Bootstrap UI (`templates/index.html`), while returning JSON to API clients and to the pytest test client (which sends no `Accept` header).
- **Input validation** — POST endpoints return `400 Bad Request` with a descriptive error message when required fields are missing or malformed.

---

### Phase 2 — Version Control System (VCS) Strategy

A Git repository was initialised locally and pushed to a publicly accessible GitHub repository using proper branching and commit conventions.

**Repository:**
[https://github.com/kshitizranjan15/Introduction\_to\_DEVOPS\_-S2-25\_SEZG514-\_Assignment1](https://github.com/kshitizranjan15/Introduction_to_DEVOPS_-S2-25_SEZG514-_Assignment1)

**Branching strategy:**

| Branch type       | Naming convention      | Purpose                         |
|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Stable production | `main`                 | Always deployable; CI must pass |
| Feature dev       | `feature/<short-desc>` | New features (merged via PR)    |
| Bug fixes         | `fix/<short-desc>`     | Bug corrections                 |
| Infrastructure    | `ci/<short-desc>`      | CI/CD or Dockerfile changes     |

**Commit message convention (Conventional Commits):**

```
feat(api): add POST /workouts endpoint
fix(validation): return 400 when email has no @ symbol
ci(actions): load Docker image into runner before docker run
docs(readme): add student details and assignment problem statement
```

---

### Phase 3 — Unit Testing & Validation Framework

Pytest is used to implement a suite of unit tests that validate application logic **before** the build stage. Tests act as an automated quality gate — broken logic cannot pass CI.

**File:** `tests/test_app.py`
**Setup:** `tests/conftest.py` — prepends the repository root to `sys.path` so pytest can import `app` without manually configuring `PYTHONPATH`.

**Tests implemented:**

| Test name                     | What it validates                                                        |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `test_index_and_health`       | Root returns 200 with `status: ok`; `/health` returns `status: healthy` |
| `test_create_and_get_workout` | POST /workouts creates a record; GET /workouts lists it                  |
| `test_workout_validation`     | POST /workouts with missing `duration_minutes` returns 400              |
| `test_create_and_get_member`  | POST /members creates a record; GET /members lists it                   |
| `test_member_validation`      | POST /members with invalid email returns 400                            |

**Confirmed test result (local execution):**

```
5 passed in 0.14s
```

---

### Phase 4 — Containerization with Docker

The Flask application, its dependencies, and its runtime environment are fully encapsulated in a portable Docker image.

**Dockerfile strategy:**

| Layer                   | Detail                                                                         |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Base image              | `python:3.11-slim` — minimal footprint, reduced attack surface                 |
| Environment variables   | `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1`, `PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR=off`                                  |
| Dependency installation | Pinned `requirements.txt` for reproducible builds                              |
| Production runtime      | `gunicorn` (WSGI server, not the Werkzeug dev server)                         |
| Exposed port            | `5000`                                                                         |
| Tests in image          | `tests/` is **not** excluded from `.dockerignore` so `pytest` runs in CI      |

**Build and run:**

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t aceest:local .

# Run the application (http://localhost:5000)
docker run --rm -p 5000:5000 aceest:local

# Run tests inside the container (mirrors CI)
docker run --rm aceest:local pytest -q
```

---

### Phase 5 — Jenkins BUILD & Quality Gate

A **Declarative Jenkins Pipeline** (`Jenkinsfile`) is provided at the repository root. Jenkins serves as a secondary automated validation layer — on every push it pulls the latest code, installs dependencies in a clean virtual environment, executes the test suite, and builds the Docker image.

**Jenkins runs locally inside Docker using a custom image (`aceest-jenkins:local`):**

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name aceest-jenkins \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home \
  aceest-jenkins:local
```

**Pipeline stages:**

| Stage                     | Action                                                       |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Checkout**              | `checkout scm` — pull latest commit from GitHub              |
| **Setup Python**          | `python3 -m venv .venv`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`  |
| **Lint / Syntax Check**   | `python -m compileall .`                                    |
| **Unit Tests**            | `pytest -q --junitxml=test-results/results.xml`             |
| **Build Docker Image**    | `docker build -t aceest:build-N .`                          |
| **Test Inside Container** | `docker run --rm aceest:build-N pytest -q`                  |

---

### Phase 6 — Automated CI/CD Pipeline via GitHub Actions

**Workflow file:** `.github/workflows/main.yml`

The pipeline triggers on **every push and pull request** to any branch, providing instant feedback to the developer.

**Pipeline architecture:**

```
Push / Pull Request
       |
       v
+---------------------+   passes   +--------------------------+
|   build-and-test    | ---------> |  docker-build-and-test   |
+---------------------+            +--------------------------+
```

**Job 1: `build-and-test`**

| Step                 | Action                              |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Checkout code        | `actions/checkout@v4`               |
| Set up Python 3.11   | `actions/setup-python@v4`          |
| Install dependencies | `pip install -r requirements.txt`   |
| Syntax / lint check  | `python -m compileall .`            |
| Run unit tests       | `pytest -q`                         |

**Job 2: `docker-build-and-test`** *(depends on job 1)*

| Step                       | Action                                                  |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Checkout code              | `actions/checkout@v4`                                   |
| Set up Docker Buildx       | `docker/setup-buildx-action@v2`                        |
| Build Docker image         | `docker/build-push-action@v4` with **`load: true`**    |
| Run tests inside container | `docker run --rm aceest:ci pytest -q`                  |

> **Why `load: true`?** Docker Buildx builds into a build cache but does not load the image into the runner's local Docker daemon by default. Without `load: true`, `docker run aceest:ci` fails with _"Unable to find image"_. This flag ensures the image is available for subsequent `docker run` steps in the same job.

## CI/CD Pipeline — Live Evidence (Screenshots)

The following screenshots document the complete end-to-end CI/CD journey — from the first push to GitHub, through GitHub Actions running in the cloud, to the Jenkins pipeline running locally in Docker. Each screenshot captures a distinct, significant milestone in the pipeline lifecycle.

---

### Screenshot 1 — First Push to GitHub: CI Check In Progress

![GitHub CI check in progress — first push](images/01_github_ci_in_progress.png)

**What this shows:**
Immediately after the very first `git push` to `main`, GitHub detects the `.github/workflows/main.yml` file and triggers the **CI / build-and-test** job automatically. The yellow dot next to commit `07c132d` indicates the check is **in progress**. The pop-up tooltip reads *"1 in progress check — CI / build-and-test (push) — In progress — This check has started..."*.

**Key DevOps concept — Continuous Integration trigger:**
This is the GitHub Actions webhook firing in real time. Every push to any branch triggers the workflow without any manual intervention, giving the developer immediate automated feedback directly on the GitHub commit view.

**Pipeline state at this point:**
```
git push  -->  GitHub webhook fires  -->  Actions runner provisioned  -->  Job 1 started
```

---

### Screenshot 2 — Second Commit Pushed: Unit Test Failure Detected

![GitHub second commit — unit test failing issue](images/02_github_second_commit_pending.png)

**What this shows:**
A second commit (`307ebf6`) was pushed with the message *"S2-25_SEZG514:correcting unit test failing issue"*. The yellow dot shows GitHub Actions has been triggered again for this new push. This captures the iterative fix cycle — the developer identified a failing test from the first run and pushed a corrective commit immediately.

**Key DevOps concept — Shift-left testing and iterative fixing:**
A test failure was caught by CI (not discovered in production), fixed locally, and re-pushed within minutes. The automated pipeline acts as a safety net that enforces quality on every single commit — not just at release time.

---

### Screenshot 3 — GitHub Actions: Unit Tests Pass, Docker Job Fails

![GitHub Actions — build-and-test passes, docker-build-and-test fails](images/03_github_actions_unit_pass_docker_fail.png)

**What this shows:**
The GitHub Actions run for commit `307ebf6` shows a split result:
- ✅ **`build-and-test`** — succeeded in **6 seconds**. All 5 pytest tests passed.
- ❌ **`docker-build-and-test`** — failed. The Docker in-container test step errored.

The expanded **Run tests (pytest)** step clearly shows:
```
Run pytest -q
.....    [100%]
5 passed in 0.13s
```

**Key DevOps concept — Two-stage fail-fast pipeline:**
The pipeline runs unit tests before Docker operations. Here, unit tests pass, allowing execution to reach the Docker stage where a separate issue is isolated. The two stages correctly diagnosed two independent problems without conflating them.

**Root cause of Docker failure:** The `.dockerignore` was excluding the `tests/` directory, so `pytest` inside the container could not find test files. Fixed by removing `tests` from `.dockerignore`.

---

### Screenshot 4 — GitHub Actions: Docker Job Passes

![GitHub Actions — docker-build-and-test job all steps passing](images/04_github_actions_docker_all_pass.png)

**What this shows:**
After fixing the `.dockerignore` issue, the `docker-build-and-test` job now passes in **31 seconds**. All steps are green:

| Step                                  | Status | Time |
|---------------------------------------|--------|------|
| Set up job                            | ✅     | 4s   |
| Checkout                              | ✅     | 0s   |
| Set up QEMU                           | ✅     | 5s   |
| Set up Docker Buildx                  | ✅     | 5s   |
| Build Docker image (for local runner) | ✅     | 12s  |
| Run tests inside container            | ✅     | 1s   |
| Post Build Docker image               | ✅     | 0s   |

**Key DevOps concept — Environment parity:**
The Docker build and in-container test confirm the application works identically inside the container as it does locally, eliminating the classic "works on my machine" problem.

**Fix applied:** `load: true` was added to `docker/build-push-action@v4`. Without it, Buildx builds into an isolated cache but does **not** load the image into the runner's Docker daemon, causing `docker run aceest:ci` to fail with *"Unable to find image"*.

---

### Screenshot 5 — GitHub Green Checkmark on Commit

![GitHub — green checkmark on commit confirming CI passing](images/05_github_green_checkmark.png)

**What this shows:**
The GitHub repository home page showing a **green checkmark** next to the latest commit — *"S2-25_SEZG514:correcting docker test failing issue #3"*. This is visual confirmation that **both CI jobs passed** for this commit. The repository now shows **4 commits** total.

**Key DevOps concept — Green build as quality gate:**
The green checkmark is the artefact of CI — proof, visible to every team member, that this exact commit has passed all automated quality checks. In a production environment, this status gates deployments: no green means no deploy.

---

### Screenshot 6 — Jenkins: Configure Pipeline (SCM from GitHub)

![Jenkins pipeline configuration — SCM from GitHub](images/06_jenkins_configure_pipeline.png)

**What this shows:**
The Jenkins job `aceest-fitness-gym` configured with **"Pipeline script from SCM"** — Jenkins pulls the `Jenkinsfile` directly from the GitHub repository. Key settings visible:

- **SCM:** Git
- **Repository URL:** `https://github.com/kshitizranjan15/Introduction_to_DEVOPS_-S2-25_SEZG514-_Assignment1`
- **Credentials:** None (public repository)
- **Branch Specifier:** `*/main`

**Key DevOps concept — Pipeline as Code:**
By storing the `Jenkinsfile` in Git, the pipeline definition is version-controlled alongside the application code. Any change to the build process goes through the same commit and review workflow as application changes — eliminating undocumented, click-configured Jenkins jobs that cannot be reproduced or audited.

**How Jenkins was set up locally:**
Jenkins runs inside Docker using a custom image (`aceest-jenkins:local`) built from `Dockerfile.jenkins`. The container mounts the host Docker socket so Jenkins can execute Docker commands. A custom `docker-entrypoint.sh` automatically runs `chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock` on every container start to fix the Docker socket permission issue.

---

### Screenshot 7 — Jenkins: Stage View — All Builds History

![Jenkins Stage View — build history with all 6 stages](images/07_jenkins_stage_view.png)

**What this shows:**
The Jenkins **Stage View** for the `aceest-fitness-gym` job showing **8 build runs** (builds #1 through #8). Builds #7 and #8 are both green (successful). The Stage View columns map directly to the stages in the `Jenkinsfile`:

| Stage                     | Avg Time | Purpose                                           |
|---------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Declarative: Checkout SCM | 1s       | Jenkins internal SCM initialisation               |
| Checkout                  | 958ms    | `checkout scm` — pull latest commit from GitHub   |
| Setup Python              | 5s       | Create `.venv`, `pip install -r requirements.txt` |

### Screenshot 9 — GitHub Commit Line Final State

![GitHub — final commit line showing green tick on main branch](images/09_github_final_green_line.png)

**What this shows:**
A close-up of the GitHub repository commit line showing the latest commit on `main` with a **green checkmark** — confirming the repository is in a fully passing state. This is the definitive evidence of a working, automated CI/CD pipeline integrated with GitHub.

**Summary of what this green tick represents:**
- Every code change was automatically tested — no manual testing required
- The Docker image was built and validated in an isolated container environment
- Jenkins independently verified the same build pipeline from a local Docker container
- The repository is in a deployable state — any team member can pull `main` and trust it works

### Screenshot 10 — Live App: Root View (Part 1 — Hero + Programs)

![ACEest live app — hero banner and training programs section](images/10_Root_view_of_app_part1.png)

**What this shows:**
The live Flask web application running in a browser at `http://localhost:5000`. The top of the page displays the **gold ACEest navbar**, the hero banner introducing the system, and the **Training Programs section** with three colour-coded cards — 🔥 Fat Loss (FL), 💪 Muscle Gain (MG), and 🌱 Beginner (BG). Each card shows the calorie factor and top exercises drawn directly from the original Tkinter version files (v1.0 through v3.2.4).

---

### Screenshot 11 — Live App: Root View (Part 2 — Program Detail Expanded)

![ACEest live app — expanded program workout and nutrition plan](images/11_Root_view_of_app_part2.png)

**What this shows:**
A program card has been clicked, expanding the **program detail panel** below the cards. Two side-by-side dark boxes display the full weekly **Workout Plan** and the **Nutrition Plan** for the selected program — content fetched live from the `GET /programs/<code>` endpoint. This mirrors the original desktop app's workout/diet display tab from Aceestver-1.0 onwards, now delivered as a REST API response.

---

### Screenshot 12 — Live App: Root View (Part 3 — Workouts & Members)

![ACEest live app — workout log and members registration sections](images/12_Root_view_of_app_part3.png)

**What this shows:**
The **Workout Log** section (left) and **Members** section (right) in the dark-themed UI. Both sections show live-updating lists fed by `GET /workouts` and `GET /members`, with a badge count in the card header. The forms on the right allow logging a new workout or registering a new member, which `POST` to the respective API endpoints and refresh the list without a page reload.

---

### Screenshot 13 — Live App: Root View (Part 4 — Gym Info & Version Timeline)

![ACEest live app — gym metrics and version history sections](images/13_Root_view_of_app_part4.png)

**What this shows:**
The bottom of the main page, showing the **Gym Capacity & Metrics** section with three metric boxes (Capacity: 150 users · Area: 10,000 sq ft · Break-even: 250 members) sourced from `GET /gym-info`, followed by the **Version History timeline** charting the evolution of the application from `Aceestver-1.0` (basic Tkinter) through all 10 desktop versions to the final Flask web API with Docker and CI/CD.

---

### Screenshot 14 — Live App: Calorie Calculator in Action

![ACEest live app — calorie calculator showing result](images/14_calorie_calc.png)

**What this shows:**
The **Calorie Calculator** in use. A body weight has been entered and a program selected; after clicking **Calculate**, the result card displays the daily calorie target in large gold text, with the full breakdown formula below it (`weight_kg × factor = kcal/day`). The calculation is performed by the `POST /calories` endpoint using the `calorie_factor` values (FL=22, MG=35, BG=26) sourced directly from Aceestver-1.1 through v3.2.4.

---

### Screenshot 15 — Live App: Logging a Workout

![ACEest live app — workout entry form and live log list](images/15_workout_log_adding.png)

**What this shows:**
A workout being logged via the form. The **workout name** and **duration in minutes** have been entered; upon submission the entry appears instantly in the live list on the left via `POST /workouts`, and the badge counter increments. This demonstrates the in-memory store updating in real time without any page refresh — a feature available across all API-backed sections.

---

### Screenshot 16 — Live App: Registering a Member

![ACEest live app — member registration form with program selection](images/16_register_member.png)

**What this shows:**
The **Register Member** form completed with a member's name, email, and selected training program (FL / MG / BG). On submission, `POST /members` creates the entry and the member appears in the list with a colour-coded program badge — matching the program colours from the original Aceestver desktop suite (🔴 FL, 🟢 MG, 🔵 BG). This closes the loop between the web UI, the REST API, and the original business logic.

## DevOps Concepts Applied — Learning Outcomes

### 1. Shift-Left Testing
Tests run at the **earliest possible stage** — before Docker build, before deployment. Any broken logic is caught in Job 1 of GitHub Actions and in the Jenkins `Unit Tests` stage, long before the image reaches a registry or server.

### 2. Immutable Infrastructure
The Docker image is built fresh on every CI run from a pinned `requirements.txt`. There is no manual installation or configuration on the server — the entire environment is described as code and reproduced identically everywhere.

### 3. Pipeline as Code
Both CI/CD pipelines are version-controlled alongside the application:
- `.github/workflows/main.yml` — GitHub Actions workflow
- `Jenkinsfile` — Jenkins Declarative Pipeline

Pipeline changes go through the same review process as application code changes.

### 4. Fail Fast Principle
The two-job GitHub Actions structure (`build-and-test` → `docker-build-and-test`) implements fail-fast ordering: if unit tests fail, the Docker build job never starts. This saves compute time and gives instant feedback.

### 5. Environment Parity (Dev / CI / Production)

| Environment    | Runtime                         | Port |
|----------------|---------------------------------|------|
| Local dev      | `python app.py` (Flask dev)     | 8000 |
| Docker local   | `gunicorn` inside container     | 5000 |
| GitHub Actions | `gunicorn` in `python:3.11-slim`| 5000 |
| Jenkins        | Same Docker image               | 5000 |

### 6. Declarative over Imperative
The `Jenkinsfile` uses **Declarative Pipeline syntax**. Declarative pipelines are easier to read, enforce a consistent structure, and provide built-in post-build actions (`post { always {} failure {} }`).

## Project Evolution — Version History

The application was progressively developed from baseline scripts in the `The code versions for DevOps Assignment/` directory:

| Version file         | What it introduced                      |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `Aceestver-1.0.py`   | Initial script — basic Python structure |
| `Aceestver-1.1.py`   | Early iteration with minor updates      |
| `Aceestver-2.1.2.py` | Service logic expansion                 |
| `Aceestver-2.2.1.py` | Validation additions                    |
| `Aceestver-2.2.4.py` | Refinements to endpoints                |
| `Aceestver-3.0.1.py` | Modularisation begin                    |
| `Aceestver-3.1.2.py` | Factory pattern introduction            |
| `Aceestver-3.2.4.py` | Production-readiness improvements       |
| `Aceestver1.1.2.py`  | Merged iteration                        |
| `Aceestver2.0.1.py`  | Final pre-DevOps baseline               |
| **`app.py`**         | **Final DevOps-ready Flask application**|

## Security Considerations

| Area                  | Practice applied                                                               |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dependency pinning    | All packages pinned to exact versions — prevents supply-chain drift            |
| No credentials in code| No passwords, API keys, or tokens committed                                   |
| Minimal base image    | `python:3.11-slim` excludes unnecessary OS packages — smaller attack surface   |
| Input validation      | All POST endpoints validate and reject malformed input before processing        |
| `.dockerignore`       | Local virtualenvs, `.git`, and build artefacts excluded from the image context |

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                                       | Root Cause                                 | Fix                                                                     |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Address already in use` on port 8000         | Another process using the port             | `pkill -f 'python3 app.py'` then restart                               |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'`  | `PYTHONPATH` not set for pytest            | `tests/conftest.py` handles this automatically                          |
| `no tests ran in 0.00s` inside Docker         | `tests/` was excluded from build context   | Remove `tests` from `.dockerignore`                                    |
| `Unable to find image 'aceest:ci'` in CI      | Buildx image not loaded into runner daemon | Add `load: true` to `docker/build-push-action`                         |
| `MIMEAccept has no attribute 'get'`           | Werkzeug 3.x incompatible with Flask 2.2.5 | Pin `Werkzeug==2.3.7` in `requirements.txt`                            |
| Docker socket `permission denied` in Jenkins  | Socket owned by root                       | `docker-entrypoint.sh` runs `chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock` on start  |
| Jenkins `Invalid username or password`        | Corrupted bcrypt hash in user config.xml   | Reset hash to known-good bcrypt hash for `admin123`                    |
| Groovy `unexpected token: }` in Jenkinsfile   | Duplicate `pipeline {}` block in file      | Rewrite `Jenkinsfile` from scratch using heredoc                        |

## Appendix — Useful Commands

```bash
# Check for port conflicts
lsof -t -i:8000

# Syntax-check all Python files
python -m compileall .

# View running containers
docker ps

# Remove all stopped containers
docker container prune -f

# Trigger Jenkins build manually via API (use Jenkins username and API token)
# Create a Jenkins API token for your user via the Jenkins UI:
#  Jenkins → People → <your user> → Configure → Add/Show API Token
#
# For automation, export the credentials into environment variables (do NOT commit these values):
#
#   export JENKINS_USER="your-jenkins-username"
#   export JENKINS_API_TOKEN="<your-api-token-here>"
#
# Alternatively store them in your local OS keyring or CI secret store and inject at runtime.
#
# Obtain the CSRF crumb and trigger a build (uses HTTP basic auth with user:APITOKEN):
CRUMB=$(curl -s -u "$JENKINS_USER:$JENKINS_API_TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8080/crumbIssuer/api/json" \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json;d=json.load(sys.stdin);print(d['crumb'])")
curl -s -u "$JENKINS_USER:$JENKINS_API_TOKEN" -H "Jenkins-Crumb:$CRUMB" \
  -X POST "http://localhost:8080/job/aceest-fitness-gym/build"

# Check last Jenkins build result (again using user:APITOKEN)
curl -s -u "$JENKINS_USER:$JENKINS_API_TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8080/job/aceest-fitness-gym/lastBuild/api/json?tree=number,result,building" \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); \
    print('Build #'+str(d['number']), '| Result:', d['result'])"
```

Deployment screenshot

![Deployed VM screenshot](images/17_vm_deployed_image.png)

Deployment notes & reproduction

1. Clone the repository on the VM (already done for this submission):

```bash
cd ~/Introduction_to_DEVOPS_-S2-25_SEZG514-_Assignment1
```

2. If you have the image locally on your workstation (macOS) at:

`/Users/kshitizranjan15/Library/Application Support/Code/User/workspaceStorage/vscode-chat-images/image-1775293114849.png`

run this (on your Mac) to copy the screenshot into the repo, commit and push it to GitHub:

```bash
# ensure destination folder exists in repo
mkdir -p ~/Introduction_to_DEVOPS_-S2-25_SEZG514-_Assignment1/images
cp "/Users/kshitizranjan15/Library/Application Support/Code/User/workspaceStorage/vscode-chat-images/image-1775293114849.png" \
  ~/Introduction_to_DEVOPS_-S2-25_SEZG514-_Assignment1/images/17_vm_deployed_image.png
cd ~/Introduction_to_DEVOPS_-S2-25_SEZG514-_Assignment1
git add images/17_vm_deployed_image.png
git commit -m "docs: add VM deployment screenshot"
git push origin main
```

If you prefer to copy the file directly on the VM (for example via scp), use:

```bash
# from your Mac: replace <VM_USER> and <VM_HOST> with the VM details
# copy the screenshot to the repo images folder (rename to 17_vm_deployed.png)
# copy the screenshot to the repo images folder (rename to 17_vm_deployed_image.png)
scp "/Users/kshitizranjan15/Library/Application Support/Code/User/workspaceStorage/vscode-chat-images/image-1775293114849.png" \
  <VM_USER>@<VM_HOST>:~/Introduction_to_DEVOPS_-S2-25_SEZG514-_Assignment1/images/17_vm_deployed_image.png
# then on VM:
cd ~/Introduction_to_DEVOPS_-S2-25_SEZG514-_Assignment1
git add images/17_vm_deployed_image.png
git commit -m "docs: add VM deployment screenshot"
git push origin main
```

Re-deploy quick commands (on VM):

Note: a `docker-compose.yml` is included at the repository root. It builds the image and maps host port 80 → container port 5000 so the app will be reachable on the VM's HTTP port without specifying a port in the browser.

```bash
cd ~/Introduction_to_DEVOPS_-S2-25_SEZG514-_Assignment1/deploy || cd ~/Introduction_to_DEVOPS_-S2-25_SEZG514-_Assignment1
docker compose up -d --build
# or fallback (build & run directly)
docker build -t aceest:local .
docker run -d --name aceest -p 80:5000 aceest:local
```

### Screenshot 18 — Deployment on VM via Docker

This screenshot shows two useful verification panels captured on the VM:

- the Docker status (the output of `docker ps` / `docker compose ps`) showing the running `aceest-web` container, and
- the live application served by the container in a browser (HTTP response / UI visible).

![Deployment on VM via Docker — docker ps and app view](images/18_Deployment_on_vm_via_docker.png)

Quick commands to reproduce the checks shown in the screenshot (run these on the VM):

```bash
# show running containers and confirm the web container is up
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}	{{.Image}}	{{.Status}}	{{.Ports}}"

# if you used the compose file in repo root
docker compose ps

# show container logs (follow)
docker logs -f aceest-web

# quick HTTP check from the VM (should return HTML index)
curl -sS http://localhost/ | head -n 5

# test the API health endpoint
curl -sS http://localhost/health
```

How to add the screenshot file into the repository (if it's on your Mac):

```bash
# from your Mac (adjust the source path if needed)
mkdir -p ~/Introduction_to_DEVOPS_-S2-25_SEZG514-_Assignment1/images
cp "/path/to/18_Deployment_on_vm_via_docker.png" \
  ~/Introduction_to_DEVOPS_-S2-25_SEZG514-_Assignment1/images/18_Deployment_on_vm_via_docker.png
cd ~/Introduction_to_DEVOPS_-S2-25_SEZG514-_Assignment1
git add images/18_Deployment_on_vm_via_docker.png
git commit -m "docs: add VM deployment docker-status + app screenshot (18)"
git push origin main
```

Or, scp the file to the VM and commit there (replace <VM_USER>@<VM_HOST>):

```bash
scp "/path/to/18_Deployment_on_vm_via_docker.png" <VM_USER>@<VM_HOST>:~/Introduction_to_DEVOPS_-S2-25_SEZG514-_Assignment1/images/18_Deployment_on_vm_via_docker.png
# then on the VM:
cd ~/Introduction_to_DEVOPS_-S2-25_SEZG514-_Assignment1
git add images/18_Deployment_on_vm_via_docker.png
git commit -m "docs: add VM deployment docker-status + app screenshot (18)"
git push origin main
```

Security reminder

- Do not store plaintext credentials in the repository. The README previously contained a Jenkins password — remove it and rotate the password if it was used. Use Jenkins API tokens or Jenkins Credentials instead.
